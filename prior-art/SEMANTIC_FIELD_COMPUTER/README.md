# **ASCπ FieldLab — Reproduction Package**

**Version:** 1.0
**Project:** ASCπ Semantic Field Computing
**License:** Humanity Heritage License π

## **1. Purpose**

This folder provides a **full reproducibility archive** for ASCπ FieldLab experiments.
It contains all data, exports, visualizations, and metadata required to:

* independently verify semantic-field computations
* reproduce ASCπ engine output
* compare results across engine versions
* validate scientific claims
* audit semantic-field behavior
* establish technical prior art

All files in this directory are **immutable snapshots** of specific experiment runs.

---

## **2. Contents of This Directory**

The folder may include:

### **2.1. JSON Field Exports**

Files generated by ASCπ FieldLab containing:

* ψ-vectors for each text segment
* ΔΦ (tension), κ (curvature), θ (phase), N (energy), C (coherence)
* memory attractor (M∞) snapshots
* timeline evolution data
* interference measurements
* engine metadata and timestamps

These files allow exact reconstruction of semantic-field dynamics.

---

### **2.2. SVG Visualizations**

Vector-based representations of field structures:

* ΔΦ–κ scatter plots
* θ-phase radial maps
* coherence timelines
* semantic interference curves

Each SVG is reproducible using the same engine version and input text.

---

### **2.3. Source Text Inputs**

Original `.txt` files used in experiments for:

* segmentation validation
* reproducibility
* comparative analysis
* text-field correlation studies

---

### **2.4. Manifest Files**

A `manifest.json` may include:

* engine version hash
* environment metadata
* file listing
* cryptographic integrity checks
* timeline indices
* memory evolution parameters

This ensures forensic transparency.

---

## **3. Scientific Use**

Researchers may use the reproduction package to:

* replicate ASCπ computations deterministically
* measure semantic-field behaviour
* analyze field coherence across segments
* study curvature/phase relationships
* compare different text domains
* validate theoretical predictions about semantic fields
* benchmark future ASCπ engine versions

Since ASCπ is deterministic and non-probabilistic, identical inputs **must** yield identical outputs.

## **4. File Naming Conventions**

```
repro/
│
├── input_*.txt                 # Original experiment input
├── export_*.json               # Full ψ-field export
├── scatter_*.svg               # ΔΦ–κ scatter visualization
├── polar_*.svg                 # θ-phase mapping
├── timeline_*.svg              # Memory (M∞) evolution
├── interference_*.svg          # A/B interference curves
└── manifest.json               # Metadata + hashes
```

Timestamps or run-identifiers are included to distinguish experiment sets.

---

## **5. Reproduction Instructions**

To reproduce results:

1. Open ASCπ FieldLab
2. Load the corresponding `.json` export
3. Regenerate scatter, polar, timeline, or interference visualizations
4. Compare ψ-values and coherence metrics with the archive
5. Confirm deterministic behaviour across the engine version used

No randomness or machine-learning processes are involved.

---

## **6. Role in Prior Art and Verification**

This folder serves as:

### **• Technical Prior Art**

Documented engine behaviour prevents proprietary claims by third parties.

### **• Transparency Layer**

External entities can independently reproduce results.

### **• Scientific Record**

FieldLab outputs can be cited in academic work.

### **• Audit Trail**

Field evolution and memory-attractor behaviour are preserved exactly as computed.

### **• Stability Baseline**

Future versions of ASCπ can be benchmarked against archived runs.

## **8. Modification Policy**

* Files in this folder **must not** be altered after publication.
* Each new experiment should use a new file series or timestamp.
* Repro data is archival, not a workspace.
