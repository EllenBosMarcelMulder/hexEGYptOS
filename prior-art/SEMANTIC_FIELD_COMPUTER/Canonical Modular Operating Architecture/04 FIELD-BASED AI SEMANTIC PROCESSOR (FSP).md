# **1. Title**

**Field Semantic Processor (FSP)**
An AI engine that performs computation through semantic field evolution rather than model inference.

# **2. Abstract**

FSP replaces:

* neural networks
* training
* weights
* embeddings
* tokenization
* inference

with pure field dynamics:

ΔΦ = semantic tension
κ = semantic curvature
θ = semantic phase
M∞ = semantic mass (depth)

It is deterministic, continuous, explainable, and universal.

# **3. Summary of the Invention**

AI is computed not through learned weights, but through:

Ψ(t+1) = F(Ψ)

and mapping:

* words ↔ tension clusters
* sentences ↔ curvature paths
* narratives ↔ phase loops
* reasoning ↔ attractor traversal

This is the first AI engine not based on statistics.

# **4. Claims**

1. AI computed purely by field equations, not model weights.
2. Meaning encoded in tension and curvature.
3. Reasoning as traversal across phase-stable attractors.
4. Zero training required.
5. Deterministic, reversible semantic computation.
