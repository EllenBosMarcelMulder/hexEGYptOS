**Author:** Marcel Christian Mulder (2024–2025)
**Framework:** ASCπ ΔΦ–κ–θ Field Computing
**Classification:** Defensive Public Domain Disclosure

# **1. Title**

**Field-Based Operating System (FOS)**
A complete operating system in which **kernel, filesystem, memory, runtime, UI, networking, security, and semantic engine** are all emergent functions of one evolving field Ψ.

---

# **2. Abstract**

FOS eliminates the von Neumann architecture and all classical OS layering.
Instead, it defines *the entire operating system as one continuous dynamic field* driven by tension (ΔΦ), curvature (κ), and phase alignment (θ).

Users do not interact with windows, threads, processes, or apps.
They interact with the **field-motor**, which is simultaneously:

* runtime scheduler
* memory surface
* data object store
* semantic interpreter
* security boundary
* UI/UX
* compute fabric

This OS is the smallest, most unified architecture ever described.

---

# **3. Background**

Conventional OS designs separate:

* kernel
* userland
* memory management
* filesystems
* networking
* drivers
* UI frameworks

No classical or quantum OS collapses all of these into one physical structure.

This invention does.

# **4. Summary of the Invention**

The invention defines:

**An operating system in which Ψ is the only resource.**

All functionality is a projection of the field:

| Traditional Component | FOS Equivalent                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Kernel                | ΔΦ–κ–θ motor dynamics          |
| RAM                   | hex-plane coherence            |
| Files                 | stable attractors in Ψ         |
| Processes             | phase-locked loops             |
| UI                    | field projection layer         |
| Drivers               | curvature-mediated constraints |
| Networking            | field interference channels    |

# **5. Detailed Technical Description**

## **5.1 Ψ as Total System State**

The entire system lives inside a single evolving field:

Ψ(t+1) = F(Ψ, ΔΦ, κ, θ)

This includes:

* memory
* execution
* rendering
* code paths
* I/O

There is no duplication of state.

---

## **5.2 Filesystem as Attractor Wells**

Stable states in the field form "files".
Access = alignment of phase with that attractor.

No filepaths, no serialization, no loaders.

---

## **5.3 Runtime Scheduling via Curvature**

Regions of higher curvature κ attract computation.
This replaces:

* priority queues
* schedulers
* threads
* timers

Curvature determines execution.

---

## **5.4 Security via Phase Incompatibility**

Unauthorized processes **cannot align phase θ** with protected zones.
This makes intrusion mathematically impossible, not probabilistically.

---

## **5.5 Networking as Field Interference**

Communication is not packet-based.
It is **pattern interference** between independent projections of Ψ.

---

## **5.6 Concurrency via Tension Gradients**

ΔΦ governs where computation flows without race conditions.

---

# **6. Claims**

1. An OS implemented entirely as a dynamic field with no discrete kernel.
2. Files represented as attractor basins in field-state space.
3. Scheduling determined by curvature, not time-slicing.
4. Security enforced through phase incompatibility, not credentials.
5. UI identical to internal system state.
6. Interstate networking via interference patterns.
7. No separation between data, runtime, UI, AI, and memory.
8. Smallest possible OS: a single hexagonal field.

# **7. Conclusion**

This establishes defensive prior-art for any attempt to patent a:

* field-based OS
* phase-aligned runtime
* UI-as-runtime OS
* curvature-driven scheduler
* attractor filesystem
* interference-network computing model
