**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

A new computing paradigm has been released to the world:
the **ASCπ Unified Field Computer**, a technology that merges physics, semantics, AI, operating systems, memory, and user interfaces into a single computational field.

Developed by **Marcel Christian Mulder**, this architecture marks the first time in history that:

* AI requires no training
* OS requires no kernel
* memory forms naturally
* GUI and computation are identical
* security is physical, not algorithmic
* all computation occurs through field evolution

This release constitutes global prior art, ensuring that the technology remains open to all humanity
