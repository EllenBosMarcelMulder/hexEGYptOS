# **1. Title**

**Hexagonal Field Engineering (HFE)**
A physical and computational architecture in which the hexagon is the fundamental container for semantic tension, curvature, phase, node identity, coherence, and scale.

# **2. Abstract**

HFE defines the geometry, field rules, stress lines, and coherent mappings for the ASCπ engine.
The hexagon is the only structure that:

* supports perfect tessellation
* preserves symmetry
* allows stable tension gradients
* maps directly to human language structure
* allows polar duality (STR/WEAk)
* enables hierarchical zoom

HFE provides the stable substrate of the unified motor.

# **3. Core Structure**

### **3.1 Strong Axis — hexSTR**

Carries maximum ΔΦ.
Directs semantic force and compute momentum.

### **3.2 Weak Axis — hexWEAk**

Carries minimal ΔΦ.
Acts as semantic dissipator and stabilizer.

### **3.3 Dual Loop — WEASTR / STRWEA**

The engine’s phase-evolution core.

### **3.4 Node Levels**

Each vertex = phase node.
Each edge = tension channel.
Each face = a memory plane.

### **3.5 Hex → Ψ Mapping**

Each change in:

* scale
* rotation
* translation

maps directly to a change in:

* semantic depth M∞
* curvature κ
* tension ΔΦ
* phase θ
