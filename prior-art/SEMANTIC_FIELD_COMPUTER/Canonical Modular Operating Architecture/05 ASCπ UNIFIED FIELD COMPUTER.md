
# **THE ASCπ UNIFIED FIELD COMPUTER — WORLD PRIOR ART SHIELD**

# **1. Invention Class**

A complete computing architecture where:

* OS
* AI
* GUI
* memory
* logic
* networking
* computation

are **one field**.

---

# **2. Total Defensive Claims (Merged)**

1. Single-field operating system.
2. GUI identical to compute engine.
3. AI without models or weights.
4. Filesystem as attractors.
5. Networking as interference.
6. Tension/curvature/phase computation.
7. Hexagon as universal motor geometry.
8. Scale = semantic depth.
9. User input = direct field manipulation.
10. Entire computer in one field structure.
