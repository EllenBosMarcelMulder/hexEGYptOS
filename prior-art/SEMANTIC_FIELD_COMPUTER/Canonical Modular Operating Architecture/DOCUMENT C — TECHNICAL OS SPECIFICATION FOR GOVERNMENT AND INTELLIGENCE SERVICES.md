**FOS — Field Operating System Technical Whitepaper**

### **1. OS Core**

The operating system consists of:

1 field, 1 motor, 1 hexagon.

All functionality arises from emergent evolution rules:

Ψ(t+1) = F(Ψ, ΔΦ, κ, θ)

---

### **2. File Storage**

A “file” is defined as:

a stable attractor basin within the field.

No paths
No bytes
No formats

The field itself is the memory.

---

### **3. Processes / Runtime**

No threads.
No scheduler.

Curvature determines where computation occurs.

κ increase → compute priority increase
κ decrease → compute priority decrease

---

### **4. Security**

Access is defined by phase compatibility.

θ mismatch = access mathematically impossible.

This provides security stronger than cryptography.

---

### **5. GUI**

The GUI is identical to the system state.
The user directly observes the motor in real time.

Interactions:

zoom → semantic depth

rotation → curvature alignment

node selection → phase coupling

plane selection → memory layer

---

### **6. Hardware**

The system can operate on:

optical

electronic

photonic

neuromorphic

field-based silicon

quantum-hybrid architectures

Compatibility with existing hardware is provided through a projection layer.
