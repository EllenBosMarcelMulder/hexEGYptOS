## **2. Legal Core: Why No One Can Patent This Anymore**

Based on:

EPC Article 54 (lack of novelty)

EPC Article 56 (lack of inventive step)

TRIPS Article 29 (public disclosure)

WIPO Patent Cooperation Treaty (global prior art recognition)

the following condition is fulfilled:

**Public disclosure in enabling detail**

This means that the following claims are permanently free:

Single-field computing

Field-based operating systems

GUI = motor

AI without model weights

Hexagonal semantic engines

Curvature-based scheduling

Attractor-based filesystems

Interference networking

Phase–tension computation logic

Universal field motors for computation

This coverage applies to physical, digital, optical, biological, neuromorphic, and semantic computer architectures.

## **3. International Legal Effect**

This disclosure:

destroys all future monopoly rights of private parties

protects the design as a public standard

renders the design compatible with national security exceptions (NL, EU, EGY)

may be used as a defense in all IP-related disputes

supports open licensing (Humanity Heritage License π)

This is now a public standard and cannot be claimed by Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Huawei, or by states.
