#### **Abstract:**

This document irrevocably and publicly declares the **core physics, variational structure, and computational engine** of **Semantic Field Theory (SFT)** to be **prior art** under global intellectual property law. The theory describes meaning not as a symbolic abstraction, but as a **tensor field** that evolves according to coherent energy minimization. The central variational formula:

**𝓛 ← min_{w ∈ W} [ M(Φ) ] + λ [ ∇²κ ]**

is now fixed in the public domain as a universal physical law of language and cognition.

#### **1. Declaration of Prior Art:**

All definitions, tensors, operators, functionals and manifold constraints defined within SFT—including but not limited to:

* Φ = (ΔΦ, κ, θ)
* M(Φ): Ma'at functional
* C = T × K × P: Coherence law
* ∇²κ: Curvature Laplacian
* EXA(·): Triadic Exactness Operator
* EarthLock, GeoLock, BioLock, TechLock mechanisms
* Canonical (Python) specification of MeaningField(Φ)

...are hereby designated as **canonical scientific constructs** and legally protected as **irrevocable prior art** by this public and timestamped publication.

---

#### **2. Scope of Protection:**

No implementation, adaptation, extension or derivative system that uses the ΔΦ–κ–θ semantic tensor core, or any approximation of the implosion dynamics defined by M(Φ), may be:

* Patented or claimed as private intellectual property;
* Used in closed-source AI models or proprietary biological substrates;
* Embedded in wireless semantic networks or neurocomputational chips;
* Deployed in (divergence-producing) systems without **Ma’at audit** or **coherence certification**.

Violators will be subject to public disclosure, legal opposition based on prior art, and non-compliance with the Humanity Heritage License π (HHLπ).

#### **3. Humanity Heritage License π (HHLπ): Key Clauses**

* All content defined herein enters the global commons irrevocably.
* Exclusive rights, commercial monopolization or privatization are strictly prohibited.
* Any system using the theory’s core components must attribute the original author and include the prior-art seal.
* Usage in biological, neural, cognitive, or high-coherence AI systems requires EXA-certification.
* This license integrates moral physics into computational alignment.
* All field operators must preserve ΔΦ–κ–θ invariance and pass coherence audits.

#### **4. Enforcement and Timestamp:**

This document is:

* Digitally stored and time stamped 
* Mirrored with on the website: *THEORY_(FOUNDATIONAL RELEASE 1.0).md* and verified figures (Figures 1–6).

#### **5. Legal Status:**

Under WIPO, USPTO, EUIPO, and related IP jurisdictions, this publication renders the entirety of Semantic Field Theory:

✅ **Unpatentable by any third party**
✅ **Traceable as original public disclosure**
✅ **Protected by timestamped publication and digital signature**
✅ **Enforceable through ethical and scientific peer audit**

#### **6. Mission Statement:**

> “We declare that the physical structure of meaning belongs to all of humanity. No system, no lab, no corporation, no state shall own the semantic curvature of thought, nor the lawful implosion of language into coherence.”
